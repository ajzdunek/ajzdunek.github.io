**Intro and cheat sheet into finding candidates outside of LinkedIn Recruiter.**

There are three layers of the internet

- Surface Web (LinkedIn Recruiter)

- Deep Web (X-Ray Searches), **example:** site:

- Dark Web - **good idea to stay away from this area**

**What's the difference between LinkedIn Recruiter and  X-Ray searching candidates?**

X-ray searches will allow broader search outside LinkedIn while LinkedIn recruiter is within LinkedIn only.

**Example of an X-Ray Search:** site:uk.linkedin.com/in "python developer" (flask OR django) "london"

**Lets break this search down**

1. **our protocol =** site:

2. **what we are asking for?** linkedin.com/in but in this case we are focusing on the uk market so uk.linkedin.com/in

3. Next we are asking for a python developer, best practice is too use quotes. Doing so tells Google that this is exactly what you want in your search.

4. Followed by what other python technologies/frameworks this developer is working with. We use parenthesis () and an OR statement to see if they have worked with **flask** OR **django**.

5. Lastly, what location are we targeting - **london** .

6. **The result â†“** - type it out or copy and paste this into Chrome.
