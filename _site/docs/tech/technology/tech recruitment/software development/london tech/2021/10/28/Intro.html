<p class="text-wrap mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">Hello! My name is Andrew and I'm a tech-savvy technical recruiter originally from Chicago now living in London with my wife.</p>

<p class="text-wrap mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">I started my journey with tech in 2017, self-learning the core basics - HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. By the beginning of 2018, I went through an immersive 4-month coding program at Northwestern University in Chicago, where I learned HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js and React.</p>
		
<p class="text-wrap mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">After completing the coding program I did two short internships, mainly as a Front-End Developer. Around this time, I felt as I needed more practice with programming and understanding the software development world. I took an alternative route and found myself working as a technical recruiter by the Summer of 2019, where I could utilize my knowledge of software development to connect with and talk with some of the most talented tech professionals in the industry.</p>

<p class="text-wrap mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">Being a technical recruiter has also helped me understand what startups or Fortune 500 companies look for in their candidates. One of the things I most enjoy about being a recruiter is doing an intake call with the manager and trying to understand what technologies the company is working with, what the day-to-day is like, and the challenges of finding talent. All of this has helped me better understand the tech world, what I want out of myself as a technical recruiter/software developer, and how I can help a future company achieve its goals.</p>

<p class="text-wrap mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">Besides coding and tech recruitment, I'm a musician and I like to collect vintage drum machines as well as fix them. </p>
