<p>In my end of 2022 post titled - <strong>Intro to X-Ray Searches in Recruiting</strong>, I went through the basics of how X-Ray searches worked. What site: does, why we use quotes to specify what we are targeting, parenthesis to group things together, location and using the OR statement.</p>

The result was - **site:uk.linkedin.com/in “python developer” (flask OR django) “london”**

<p>An OR statement was used in the example above, but there is another way to use OR that can sometimes produce more results or even less but more accurate results.</p>

**Let's switch it up a bit and look for a software engineer who has either used react or vue.**

<p><strong>This is the old way of using OR</strong></p>
<ul>site:uk.linkedin.com/in “software engineer” ("react.js" OR "vue.js") “london”</ul>

<p><strong>This is the new way of using |</strong></p>
<ul>site:uk.linkedin.com/in “software engineer” ("react.js"|"vue.js") “london”</ul>

I prefer the latter OR because it is clearer and easier to read. Using too many ORs can potentially lead to irrelevant results, as this is not the standard practice in Google anymore.

<p>In conclusion - use this | instead of that OR - Chrome and your productivity will thank you. </p>

**Happy Sourcing**
