            Creating a band website in Jekyll (a static site generator built in Ruby) that mixes a touch of both
            minimalism and brutalism. This music project is no longer active.

           A fully functional independent music blog built with Jekyll, a blog-aware, static site generator written in
           Ruby. One of the features I'm proud of in this project was the ability to add search functionality - the
           search data is stored in a JSON file. I'm on and off with this project - I started to get into blogging/writing 
           in late 2019 and I have periods where I begin and stop but I'm excited to write my first review for a London based 
           band soon. <strong>(Project has been put on hold)</strong>

        <p>The nice-to-haves that I'm working on currently is the mapping details to add more authors.</p>
