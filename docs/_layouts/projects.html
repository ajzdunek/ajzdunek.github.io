            minimalism and brutalism. This music project is no longer active.

           A fully functional independent music blog built with Jekyll, a blog-aware, static site generator written in
           Ruby. One of the features I'm proud of in this project was the ability to add search functionality - the
           search data is stored in a JSON file. I'm on and off with this project - I started to get into blogging/writing 
           in late 2019 and I have periods where I begin and stop but I'm excited to write my first review for a London based 
           band soon.

            Sounds that I have created using Sonic Pi. Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on Ruby, originally
            designed to support both computing and music lessons in schools. I am currently teaching myself Ruby and as 
            a musician and software developer this brings the best of both worlds. I do have sound snippets that I created 
            using Sonic Pi and have uploaded them to my SoundCloud. Links are on my README - take a listen!
