### My Web Dev Portfolio


This website originally was built with Svelte/Sapper but unfortunately due to too many bugs with Sapper I ended up rebuilding this same website with GitHub Pages and Jekyll and I have to say, I don't have too many complaints so far. 

On the top left of my repository there's a dropdown that says main - click on that and select gh-pages where you will see my file structure and code. I have included a link to to my web development portfolio which is located at the top right of this repository. Stop by and say hello!
